<div>
    This is the <strong>JSON</strong> Nomad job definition used to spawn a new agent in Nomad. You can customize it but two important things have to be kept in mind:
    <ol>
        <li><tt>Job.ID</tt> must be <tt>%WORKER_NAME%</tt></li>
        <li>JNLP agent must be started up and the agent name must be <tt>%WORKER_NAME%</tt></li>
    </ol>
    
    Below you can find a list of placeholders which are resolved before the job is being sent to Nomad.
    
    <dl>
        <dt><tt>%WORKER_NAME%</tt>
        <dd>name of the Jenkins agent (e.g. <tt>jenkins-146ddad3c95c9</tt>).</dd>
    
        <dt><tt>%WORKER_SECRET%</tt>
        <dd>secret for this agent to connect to Jenkins (e.g. <tt>7f1bc810deeba3a4624aea3ef0fbc74b6d56bdee27ea006a1c8f560aa66075d4</tt>).</dd>
    </dl>
    
    Note: The default job definition is pretty much ready to go. You only have to adjust:
    
    <ul>
        <li>the region</li>
        <li>the datacenters</li>
        <li><tt>JENKINS_URL</tt></li>
        <li><tt>JENKINS_TUNNEL</tt></li>
    </ul>
</div>
